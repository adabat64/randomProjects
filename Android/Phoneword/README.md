### Phone Word
***

This is my first Android app. It allows the user to translate a phone number with words such as 1-800-XAMARIN into the right phone number, then allows the user to choose whether to call or cancel the call.

##### Instructions
Xamarin.Android needs to be installed

* Download the Phoneword folder, and open it.
* Open the solution with Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio Xamarin tools
* Build the solution and run it on an Android Virtual Machine
